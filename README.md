# E Fundamentals Coding Challenge Create a Word cloud 

# Introduction: 

We gather raw HTML pages from retail sites this data is then processed and extracted, one of the fields extracted are product reviews. 

The example reviews in the reviews.json file are an illustration of the types of reviews we may gather.  
 
Your challenge is to process this data and display it in the form of a word cloud. 

# Requirements: 

1. Create a ReactJS component as a tabular view to display a count of the frequency of words found in reviews.  

2. Extend this to display the words as a word cloud where more frequent words are displayed larger on screen than others, you can do this simply by increasing the size of words and displaying them in a table or attempt to do it in a more interesting way, perhaps a use of a charting library.  or pull your own product reviews from a online retailer such as amazon.co.uk

3. You should include suitable unit tests 

Feel free to render as you like bearing in mind we are more interested in your construction of ReactJS components and how this is represented with real data on screen. 

# Notes 

* This should take a couple of hours, no more
* fork this repo to your own GitHub account and send the link to jordan.dick@ef.uk.com
